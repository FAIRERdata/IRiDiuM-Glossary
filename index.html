                        This interdisciplinary glossary for research data management was developed to facilitate
                        communication between the diverse stakeholders engaged in this area. The initial compilation
                        from a variety of online sources was reviewed and refined by a wide range of vocabulary and
                        domain specific experts. Community sourcing was used to refine the glossary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The need for such a glossary emerged as an increasing number of new terms have come into use to
                        refer to new concepts and as terms borrowed from other disciplines have been given new meaning.
                        The aim is a stable glossary of community accepted definitions kept relevant by maintaining a
                        'living resource' that is updated when necessary.

The information can be stored as metadata information associated with each data object. The information can be generated dynamically by applying the access controls of the collection that organizes the data objects (if a collection sticky bit is turned on).</p>

With standard hierarchical classifications, statistics for related categories can be grouped or collated (aggregated) to provide a broader picture, or categories can be split (disaggregated) when finer details are required and made possible by the codes given to primary observations. Aggregation denotes the compounding of primary data into an aggregate, usually for the purpose of expressing them in a summary form. For example, national income and price index numbers are aggregative, in contrast to the income of an individual or the price of a single commodity.</p>

In most organizations, the determination of which records are considered to have archival value is made by archivists. Sometimes, archivists distinguish between the concepts of historical value and archival value. In such cases, historical value is defined narrowly as the value of a record to support research in the history of people and the world, and archival value is defined broadly to encompass value that supports any type of research using permanent records, including psychological, sociological, and other types of scientific research.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> 1. The process of confirming the identity of a principal. Since computer identification cannot be absolute (e.g., passwords can be stolen), authentication relies on a related concept of level of trust, in which an institution relies on good identity management practice (so that the institution believes they have correctly identified an individual) and secures mechanisms for sharing identity. This is sometimes referred to as AuthN (authentication), in contrast to AuthZ (authorization). 2. A mechanism which attempts to establish the authenticity of digital materials at a particular point in time. For example, digital signatures.</p>

An evolving term that describes any voluminous amount of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data that have the potential to be mined for information. 2. Data that would take too much time and cost too much money to load into relational databases for analysis (typically petabytes and exabytes of data). 3. Extensive datasets/collections/linked data primarily characterized by big volume, extensive variety, high velocity (creation and use), and/or variability that together require a scalable architecture for efficient data storage, manipulation, and analysis. In general, the size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyze. It is assumed that as technology advances over time, the size of datasets that qualify as big data will increase. Also the definition can vary by sector, depending on what kind of software tools are commonly available and what sizes of datasets are common in a particular industry. With those caveats, big data in many sectors today will range from a few dozen terabytes to multiple petabytes (thousands of terabytes).</p>

A checksum is a type of metadata and an important property of a data object to allow verifying identity and integrity. Also called a hash, a checksum is a randomly generated piece of data that is used to verify the fixity or stability of a digital object. It is most commonly used to detect whether some representation of a digital object has changed over time. This is associated with PIDs but can be found and tested independently of PID systems.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> The process or means of obtaining and storing external data, particularly images or sounds, for use at a later time. In biometric security systems, for example, capture is the acquisition of, or the process of acquiring an identifying characteristic such as a finger image, palm image, facial image, iris print, or voice print. In order to capture the data, a transducer is employed that converts the actual image or sound into a digital file. The file is then stored. At a later time, it can be analyzed by a computer, or compared with other files in a database to verify identity or to provide authorization to enter a secured system. Screen capture is the acquisition and storage of an image on a monitor or display exactly as it appears at a specific time. This can sometimes (but not always) be done by hitting the &#34;print screen&#34; key, in which case the image appears as a bitmap file in the clipboard. It can also be done by photographing the display screen with a digital camera external to the computer. Electronic signals from scientific instruments, dataloggers, sensors, etc., can also be captured, converted to data, and stored for use at a later time.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> A managed process, throughout the data lifecycle, by which data/data collections are cleansed, documented, standardized, formatted and inter-related. This includes versioning data, or forming a new collection from several data sources, annotating with metadata, adding codes to raw data (e.g., classifying a galaxy image with a galaxy type such as &#34;spiral&#34;). Higher levels of curation involve maintaining links with annotation and with other published materials. Thus a dataset may include a citation link to publication whose analysis was based on the data. The goal of curation is to manage and promote the use of data from its point of creation to ensure it is fit for contemporary purpose and available for discovery and re-use. For dynamic datasets this may mean continuous enrichment or updating to keep it fit for purpose. Special forms of curation may be available in data repositories. The data curation process itself must be documented as part of curation. Thus curation and provenance are highly related.</p>

A data dictionary is a crucial part of a relational database as it provides additional information about the relationships between multiple tables in a database. The data dictionary in DBMS [database management system] helps the user to arrange data in a neat and well-organized way, thus preventing data redundancy. 2. A collection of descriptions of the data objects or items in a data model. A first step in analyzing a system of objects with which users interact is to identify each object and its relationship to other objects. This process is called data modeling and results in a picture of object relationships. After each data object or item is given a descriptive name, its relationship is described (or it becomes part of some structure that implicitly describes relationship), the type of data (such as text or image or binary value) is described, possible predefined values are listed, and a brief textual description is provided. This collection can be organized for reference into an eBook called a data dictionary.</p>

The traditional scientific method, in contrast, begins with a hypothesis and follows with an examination of the data. Data dredging often circumvents traditional data mining techniques and may lead to premature conclusions. Uncovered patterns may be presented as statistically significant without any specific hypothesis as to the underlying causality. Data dredging is sometimes described as &#34;seeking more information from a dataset than it actually contains.&#34;</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> A serious problem caused by one or more ineffective data analysis processes. In addition to the financial burden, problems with data quality and analysis can have a serious impact on security, compliance, project management and human resource management, among others. Error can creep into data analytics at any stage. The data quality may be inadequate in the first place. The data could be incomplete, inaccurate, not current, or may not be a reliable indicator of what they are intended to represent. Data analysis and interpretation are prone to a similar number of pitfalls. There can be confounding factors and the mathematical method can be flawed or inappropriate. Correlation can be erroneously considered to suggest causation. Statistical significance may be mistakenly attributed when the data do not support it. Even if the data and analytic processes are valid, data may be deliberately presented in a misleading manner to support an agenda. Problems arise when insufficient resources are applied to data processes and too much confidence placed in their validity. To prevent data-driven disasters, it&#39;s crucial to continually examine data quality and analytic processes, and to pay attention to common sense and even intuition. When data seem to be indicating something that does not make logical sense or just seems wrong, it is time to re-examine the source data and the methods of analysis.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> In a database, an example of a data element is a data field. One also says that a data element is an attribute of a data entity. A unit of data for which the definition, identification, representation (term used to represent it), and permissible values are specified by means of a set of attributes. For example, the data element &#34;age of a person&#34; with values consisting of all combinations of 3 decimal digits; A personnel record may include the data elements &#34;name&#34; and &#34;address&#34;. In the context of the personnel record, &#34;name&#34; and &#34;address&#34; function as an indivisible unit, e.g., the data element &#34;name&#34; and the data element &#34;address&#34; each can be stored and retrieved as an indivisible unit. However, in a different context, &#34;address&#34; itself may be considered a record that contains its own data elements &#34;street address&#34;, &#34;city&#34;, &#34;postal code&#34;, &#34;country&#34;.</p>

                        <h3>Data file format</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> The layout of a file in terms of how the data within the file are organized. A program that uses the data in a file must be able to recognize and possibly access data within the file. A particular file format is often indicated as part of a file&#39;s name by a filename extension (suffix). Conventionally, the extension is separated by a period from the name and contains three or four letters that identify the format. There are as many different file formats as there are different programs to process the files. Examples include: Word documents (.doc), Web text pages (.htm or .html), Web page images (.gif and .jpg), Adobe Postscript files (.ps), Adobe Acrobat files (.pdf), Executable programs (.exe), Multimedia files (.mp3 and others). Preferred formats are those designated by a data repository for which the digital content is maintained. If a data file is not in a preferred format, a data curator will often convert the file into a preferred format, thus ensuring that the digital content remains readable and usable. Usually, preferred formats are the de facto standard employed by a particular community.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> The process of obtaining, importing, and processing data for later use or storage in a database. This process often involves altering individual files by editing their content and/or formatting them to fit into a larger document. An effective data ingestion methodology begins by validating the individual files, then prioritizes the sources for optimum processing, and finally validates the results. When numerous data sources exist in diverse formats (the sources may number in the hundreds and the formats in the dozens), maintaining reasonable speed and efficiency can become a major challenge. To that end, several vendors offer programs tailored to the task of data ingestion in specific applications or environments.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> A repository of data designed to serve a particular community of knowledge workers. The goal of a data mart is to meet the particular demands of a specific group of users. Because data marts are optimized to look at data in a unique way, the design process tends to start with an analysis of user needs. Generally, an organization&#39;s data marts are subsets of the organization&#39;s data warehouse. A data mart tends to be tactical and aimed at meeting an immediate need. Data virtualization software can be used to create virtual data marts, pulling data from disparate sources and combining it with other data as necessary to meet the needs of specific business users. A virtual data mart provides knowledge workers with access to the data they need while preventing data silos and giving the organization&#39;s data management team a level of control over the organization&#39;s data throughout its lifecycle. The difference between a data warehouse and a data mart can be confusing because the two terms are sometimes used incorrectly as synonyms.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> Data modeling formalizes and documents existing processes and events. It captures and translates complex system designs into easily understood representations of the data flows and processes, creating a blueprint for construction and/or re-engineering. A data model can be thought of as a diagram or flowchart that illustrates the relationships between data. Although capturing all the possible relationships in a data model can be very time-intensive, it&#39;s an important step and should not be rushed. Well-documented models allow stakeholders to identify errors and make changes before any programming code has been written. Data modellers often use multiple models to view the same data and ensure that all processes, entities, relationships and data flows have been identified. There are several different approaches to data modeling, including: Conceptual Data Modeling (identifies the highest-level relationships between different entities); Enterprise Data Modeling (similar to conceptual data modeling, but addresses the unique requirements of a specific organization); Logical Data Modeling (illustrates the specific entities, attributes and relationships involved in a business function. Serves as the basis for the creation of the physical data model); Physical Data Modeling (represents an application and database-specific implementation of a logical data model).</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> The statistical analysis and assessment of the quality of data values within a dataset for consistency, uniqueness and logic. The data profiling process cannot identify inaccurate data; it can only identify business rules violations and anomalies. The insight gained by data profiling can be used to determine how difficult it will be to use existing data for other purposes. It can also be used to provide metrics to assess data quality and help determine whether or not metadata accurately describes the source data. Profiling tools evaluate the actual content, structure and quality of the data by exploring relationships that exist between value collections both within and across datasets. For example, by examining the frequency distribution of different values for each column in a table, an analyst can gain insight into the type and use of each column. Cross-column analysis can be used to expose embedded value dependencies and inter-table analysis allows the analyst to discover overlapping value sets that represent foreign key relationships between entities.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> The reliability and application efficiency of data. It is a perception or an assessment of dataset&#39;s fitness to serve its purpose in a given context. Aspects of data quality include: Accuracy, Completeness, Update status, Relevance, Consistency across data sources, Reliability, Appropriate presentation, Accessibility. Within an organization, acceptable data quality is crucial to operational and transactional processes and to the reliability of analytics, business intelligence, and reporting. Data quality is affected by the way data are entered, stored and managed. Maintaining data quality requires going through the data periodically and scrubbing it. Typically this involves updating, standardizing, and de-duplicating records to create a single view of the data, even if it is stored in multiple disparate systems. Data quality assurance (DQA) is the process of verifying the reliability and effectiveness of data.</p>

The data recovery process may vary, depending on the circumstances of the data loss, the data recovery software used to create backups, and backup target media. In some cases, end users may be able to restore lost files themselves. Restoration of a corrupted database from a tape backup is a more complicated process that requires specialized intervention. Data that were not backed up and were accidentally deleted from a computer&#39;s file system may sometimes be recovered from file fragments that remain on the disk. An organization&#39;s disaster recovery plan should make known who in the organization is responsible for recovering data, provide a strategy for how data will be recovered and document acceptable recovery point and recovery time objectives.</p>

Data residency also refers to the legal or regulatory requirements imposed on data based on the country or region in which it resides. Cloud computing, which allows organizations to deliver hosted services over the Internet, can create data residency concerns. Users need to know where their cloud provider&#39;s data centres are located across the globe as well as the different data residency policies for each respective location. To protect data from unwanted access regardless of its geographic location, organizations can use cloud data encryption tools that transform user data into ciphertext before it is stored in the cloud (e.g., CipherCloud; Vormetric; Perspecsys).</p>

Data stewards are responsible for, and Principle Investigators are consulted and informed on: (a) Preservation of data and data products; and, (b) Provision of formats (e.g., web services, NetCDF, etc.) for data discovery and integration. In addition, Principal Investigators are also responsible for data citation, as appropriate, when preparing documentation, reports, or references.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>Long Definition:</strong> A data steward manages and oversees an organization&#39;s data assets to provide data users with high quality data that are easily accessible in a consistent manner. While data governance generally focuses on high-level policies and procedures, data stewardship focuses on tactical coordination and implementation. A data steward is responsible for carrying out data usage and security policies as determined through enterprise data governance initiatives, acting as a liaison between the IT department and the business side of an organization. An effective data steward maintains agreed-upon data definitions and formats, identifies data quality issues and ensures that business users adhere to specified standards. An organization may use a data stewardship program as part of its overall data lifecycle management effort and/or to help with data quality improvement projects. A data steward collaborates with Principal Investigators, data custodians, data architects, business intelligence developers, extract, transform and load (ETL) designers, business data owners, and others to uphold data consistency and data quality metrics. Data quality tools, including data profiling software, are key technology components of many data stewardship programs.</p>

A common type is the relational database, where data are related to each other in a systematic manner so that they can be reorganised and accessed in a number of different ways. A database may house one or many datasets.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> 1. The act of minimally perturbing individual-level data to decrease the probability of discovering an individuals identity. It involves masking direct identifiers (e.g., name, phone number, address) as well as transforming indirect identifiers that could be used alone or in combination to-identify an individual (e.g., birth dates, geographic details, dates of key events). If done correctly, de-identification is a defensible, repeatable, and auditable process that consistently provides assurance, based on generally accepted and repeatable statistical methodologies, that there is a very small risk of re-identification of any data that are released. 2. The use of one or more techniques designed to make it impossible -- or at least more difficult -- to identify a particular individual from stored data related to them. The purpose of data anonymization is to protect the privacy of the individual and to make it legal for governments and businesses to share their data without obtaining permission. Such data have proven to be very valuable for researchers, particularly in health care. Data anonymization methods include removing personally identifiable information (e.g., names, addresses, social insurance numbers, Medicare numbers, etc.), or using obfuscation methods such as encryption, hashing, generalization, pseudonymization, and perturbation. As governments move forward with open government initiatives, more data are becoming publicly available over the Internet. Much of these data have been scrubbed to create &#34;limited datasets&#34;.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> In a relational database, denormalization is an approach to speeding up read performance (data retrieval) in which the administrator selectively adds back specific instances of redundant data after the data structure has been normalized. A denormalized database should not be confused with a database that has never been normalized. After data has been duplicated, the database designer must take into account how multiple instances of the data will be maintained. One way to denormalize a database is to allow the database management system (DBMS) to store redundant information on disk. This has the added benefit of ensuring the consistency of redundant copies. Another approach is to denormalize the actual logical data design, but this can quickly lead to inconsistent data. Rules called constraints can be used to specify how redundant copies of information are synchronized, but they increase the complexity of the database design and also run the risk of impacting write performance.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> The process of breaking aggregate data into component subgroups (e.g., by age, sex, income, location, ethnicity) so that differences and inequalities can be identified and monitored.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>Long Definition:</strong> Disaggregation is the breakdown of observations, usually within a common branch of a hierarchy, to a more detailed level to that at which detailed observations are taken. With standard hierarchical classifications, statistics for related categories can be grouped or collated (aggregated) to provide a broader picture, or categories can be split (disaggregated) when finer details are required and made possible by the codes given to the primary observations. Disaggregation clarifies heterogeneity within an aggregate measure and supports equity-sensitive analysis and policymaking (for example disaggregating national health data by sex, age, and disability). Effective disaggregation requires planning at collection time (sample sizes, confidentiality safeguards), consistent subgroup definitions, and documentation of methods and limitations. International guidance (e.g., SDG indicators) highlights key disaggregation dimensions and the role of disaggregated statistics in “leaving no one behind.”</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> Science supported to a significant degree by digital information-processing and/or computational technologies, or wholly based on these. Note that such a definition is functional, not some intrinsic property of the science. Data-based science, that is science which is based wholly or in part on exploiting existing information, is included within this definition. E-Science includes a very broad class of activities, as nearly all information gathering is computer based, or uses information technologies for measuring, recording, reporting, analysing. E-Science often involves intensive use of such technologies: advanced in technique, collaborative or on a large scale (over various possible measures: volumes of information, computational intensity, extent of distribution, variety of information types handled). E-Science can be conducted equally by individuals and small units - in other words, e-Science is equally relevant to small science, and indeed e-Science brings big science within the grasp of the less well-equipped - all you need is a computer.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> 1. A compilation of core electronic health data submitted by various healthcare providers and organizations, accessible by numerous authorized parties from a number of points of care, possibly even from different jurisdictions. 2. An official health record for an individual that is shared among multiple facilities and agencies. 3. Electronic health records typically include: Contact information, Information about visits to health care professionals, Allergies, Insurance information, Family history, Immunization status, Information about any conditions or diseases, A list of medications, Records of hospitalization, Information about any surgeries or procedures performed. Digitized health information systems are expected to improve efficiency and quality of care and, ultimately, reduce costs. The benefits of electronic health records include: The ability to automatically share and update information among different offices and organizations, More efficient storage and retrieval, The ability to share multimedia information, such as medical imaging results, among locations, The ability to link records to sources of relevant and current research, Easier standardization of services and patient care, Provision of decision support systems (DSS) for healthcare professionals, Less redundancy of effort, Lower cost to the medical system once implementation is complete, The governments of many countries are working to ensure that all citizens have standardized electronic health records and that all records include the same types of information. The major barrier for the adoption of electronic health records is cost.</p>

ETL processes can involve considerable complexity, and significant operational problems can occur.</p>

FAIR is not a standard or certification by itself, but a set of goals and a common language that informs policies, metadata schemas, repositories and tooling. Implementations should address persistent identifiers, rich metadata, open protocols, machine-readable licenses, and community standards for vocabularies and formats.</p>

                        <h3>Framework</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> A real or conceptual structure intended to serve as a support or guide for the building of something that expands the structure into something useful. The ability to make refinements may require that the design is fully known, and this is not necessarily known at the outset. &#34;Framework&#34; is thus sometimes used as a &#39;fuzzy&#39; term. In computer systems, a framework is often a layered structure indicating what kind of programs can or should be built and how they would interrelate. Some computer system frameworks also include actual programs, specify programming interfaces, or offer programming tools for using the frameworks. A framework may be for a set of functions within a system and how they interrelate; the layers of an operating system; the layers of an application subsystem; how communication should be standardized at some level of a network; and so forth. A framework is generally more comprehensive than a protocol and more prescriptive than a structure. Examples of frameworks that are currently used or offered by standards bodies or companies include: Resource Description Framework (a set of rules from the World Wide Web Consortium for how to describe any Internet resource such as a Web site and its content); Internet Business Framework (a group of programs that form the technological basis for the mySAP product from SAP, the German company that markets an enterprise resource management line of products); Sender Policy Framework (a defined approach and programming for making email more secure; Zachman framework (a logical structure intended to provide a comprehensive representation of an information technology enterprise that is independent of the tools and methods used in any particular IT business).</p>

                        <h3>Golden record</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> 1. A single, well-defined version of all the data entities in an organizational ecosystem. In this context, a golden record is sometimes called the &#34;single version of the truth,&#34; where &#34;truth&#34; is understood to mean the reference to which data users can turn when they want to ensure that they have the correct version of a piece of information. The golden record encompasses all the data in every system of record within a particular organization. A system of record is an information storage and retrieval system that serves as the authoritative source for a particular data element in a system containing multiple sources of the same element. To ensure data integrity, a single system of record must always exist for each and every data element. A well-maintained, current golden record should be a fundamental element of the Master Data Management policy for every enterprise. 2. The word &#34;golden&#34; is sometimes used in information technology to express the importance of some type of source. In the context of virtualization, for example, a golden image is a template for a virtual machine, virtual desktop, servers, or hard disk drive.</p>

During the Second World War, the term was used by British airmen to refer to ongoing trouble with aircraft in spite of mechanics&#39; best efforts. Gremlins sometimes appear today in computer systems and networks. Although gremlins never do their dirty work in plain sight, a gremlin is usually portrayed as a small troll-like creature. No one has ever seen one and caught it in the act of sabotaging an aircraft, radio transmitter, computer, robot, or other system. The instant any human looks for a gremlin, it vanishes, although evidence of its mischief may remain. Gremlins are particularly adept at causing intermittent malfunctions, which have been the bane of technicians and engineers for centuries.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> More formally known as the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, the identity ecosystem is a proposal from the United States federal government to improve identity authentication on the Internet and make online transactions safer. The proposal has four goals: To develop a comprehensive Identity Ecosystem framework; To build and implement an interoperable identity infrastructure aligned with the framework; To enhance confidence and willingness to participate in the Identity Ecosystem; To ensure the long-term success of the Identity Ecosystem; The proposal invites citizens to suggest ideas for creating the ecosystem. &#34;We seek a future where individuals can voluntarily choose to obtain a secure, interoperable, and privacy-enhancing credential from a variety of service providers - both public and private - to authenticate themselves online for different types of transactions.&#34; Although there has already been some resistance to the scheme from privacy advocates, it is likely that to the end user, an Identity Ecosystem will be familiar and work in much the same way as the financial ecosystem that allows people to withdraw cash from an ATM machine, even when the machine belongs to another bank in another city. The Identity Ecosystem will add another layer of security, aimed at reducing identity theft and simplifying the user experience for various other types of electronic transactions. Once the Identity Ecosystem standards are defined, the government hopes to spark adoption by making the federal government an early adopter and offering businesses financial incentives for developing, training and implementing the framework.</p>

Incumbents are promoted by appointment to a higher level in their own positions based upon the incumbent&#39;s&#39; qualifications.. Only valued outcomes are used to assess a researchers level. Valued outcomes are identified as those being expected at the respective level, for entry into that level, for each of three research contexts. At each level, the competencies, responsibilities and valued outcomes of the previous level are assumed to be included. Evidence at each level may be similar but is expected to be more extensive at higher levels. Other job types are governed by a position-based approach (e.g., Research manager).</p>

                        <h3>International standard</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> A standard that is used in multiple nations and whose development process is open to representatives from all countries. Some international standards are promulgated by multinational treaty organizations (e.g., the International Telecommunications Union (ITU); the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)). Some international standards are promulgated by multinational non treaty organizations (e.g., the International Organization for Standardization (ISO); the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)). Some international standards are promulgated by organizations that originated as national industry associations, professional societies, or standards developers, but over time evolved into a global presence with multinational participation (e.g., ASTM International, SAE International, and NFPA International). Annex 4 of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade Report 2000 contains a good discussion of what constitutes an international standard. In short, the WTO suggests that a standard may be considered international if the processes and procedures used to develop it are transparent, open, impartial, and provide meaningful opportunities for WTO members, as a minimum, to contribute to the development of the standard so that the standard does not favor any particular suppliers, countries, or regions. Equally important, the standard must have a global relevance and use.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> A document that specifies which metadata elements are to be used, how they are to be used, and under what constraints, often by combining terms from multiple metadata standards. It includes guidelines for implementation and ensures interoperability and consistency. A metadata application proﬁle is a mechanism for semantic interoperability in FAIRER and open data publishing.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>Long Definition:</strong> A metadata application profile (MAP) is a set of recorded decisions about a shared data target for a given community. MAPs declare what models are employed (what types of entities will be described and how they relate to each other), what controlled vocabularies are used, the cardinality of fields/properties (what fields are required and which fields have a cap on the number of times they can be used), data types for string values, and guiding text/scope notes for consistent use of fields/properties. A MAP may be a multipart specification, with human-readable and machine-readable aspects, sometimes in a single file, sometimes in multiple files (e.g., a human-readable file that may include input rules, a machine-readable vocabulary, and a validation schema). EXAMPLE: A MAP for a digital library might include elements such as &#34;title,&#34; &#34;author,&#34; &#34;publication date,&#34; and &#34;subject,&#34; with guidelines on how to enter data for each element and constraints such as mandatory fields or specific formats. 
Although MAPs do not necessarily have to be machine-actionable (e.g., https://pro.dp.la/hubs/metadata-application-profile), there are benefits to generating these decisions in a machine-parseable way: MAPs are more explicit when machine-actionable, providing less room for interpretation--no matter the platform used to create the data, the output should be interoperable. If the syntax of the MAP (e.g., SHACL, ShEx, YAML, JSON Schema, etc.) is supported by tooling it can possibly be reused in web form configurations or as a validation target.
Machine-actionable MAPs can be used to generate human-readable documentation for catalogers, but it is unlikely human-readable MAPs can easily produce machine-actionable files.

                        <p><strong>Long Definition:</strong> A metadata schema is a formal, machine-readable specification that defines the structure, constraints, and data types of a set of metadata elements. It is used to validate and enforce the structure of metadata instances against the defined rules. COMPONENTS: Structure (Defines the hierarchical organization of elements; Data Types (Specifies the types of data that each element can hold (e.g., string, date, URI)); Validation Rules (Includes constraints such as required elements, allowed values, and format specifications); and, Interoperability (Ensures that metadata adheres to a consistent structure for processing and exchange). EXAMPLE: A JSON Schema or XML Schema Definition (XSD) for metadata might define that the &#34;title&#34; element is a string, the &#34;publication date&#34; is a date format, and the &#34;author&#34; element is an object containing &#34;first name&#34; and &#34;last name&#34; fields.</p>

                        <h3>Murphy&#39;s Law</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> The original Murphy&#39;s Law was &#34;If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it.&#34;</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>Long Definition:</strong> The law&#39;s author was Edward A. Murphy, Jr., a U.S. Air Force engineer, who, in 1947, was involved in a rocket-sled experiment in which all 16 accelerator instruments were installed in the wrong way, resulting in Murphy&#39;s observation. Murphy&#39;s Law is sometimes expressed as &#34;Anything that can go wrong, will -- at the worst possible moment.&#34; In that format, the Law was popularized by science-fiction writer Larry Niven as &#34;Finagle&#39;s Law of Dynamic Negatives &#34; (sometimes known as &#34;Finagle&#39;s corollary to Murphy&#39;s Law&#34;). Extrapolating from the original, we arrive at Murphy&#39;s Laws of Information Technology, a set of principles that may seem to be jokes but which events sometimes prove to be fundamental truths. Examples of Murphy&#39;s Laws relative to hardware: Law of Inconvenient Malfunction (A device will fail at the least opportune possible moment); Law of Cable Compatibility (If you choose a cable and a connector at random, the probability that they are compatible is equal to zero); Law of Hardware Compatibility (The probability of a given peripheral being compatible with a PC is inversely proportional to the immediate need for that peripheral); Law of Bad Sectors (The probability that an untested diskette will have bad sectors is directly proportional to the importance of the data written onto the diskette); First Law of Selective Gravitation: (When an object is dropped, it will fall in such a way as to cause the greatest possible damage to itself and/or other objects on which it lands); Second Law of Selective Gravitation (The tendency for an object to be dropped is directly proportional to its value); Law of Reality Change (Unalterable hardware specifications will change as necessary to maximize frustration for personnel affected by said specifications); Law of Noise (Noise bursts occur so as to cause the most, and/or most serious, errors in data communications, regardless of the actual amount of noise present); Law of Expectation (Consumer expectations always outpace advances in hardware technology); and, Law of the Titanic (If a device cannot malfunction, it wil). Examples of Murphy&#39;s Laws as they relate to programming: Law of Debugging (The difficulty of debugging software is directly proportional to the number of people who will ultimately use it); Law of Neurosis (The chances of software being neurotic (developing bugs spontaneously without apparent reason) is directly proportional to the confusion such neurosis can cause); Law of Available Space (If there are n bytes in a crucial software program, the available space for its convenient storage or loading is equal to n-1 bytes); First Law of Bad Sectors (The probability of software being mutilated by bad sectors is directly proportional to the value and/or importance of the programs); Second Law of Bad Sectors (When a program is mutilated by bad sectors, the damage will occur at the point(s) that result in the most frequent and/or severe errors when the program is run); Law of Noise (When a downloaded program is corrupted by noise, the corruption will occur at the point(s) that result in the most frequent and/or severe errors when the program is run); Law of Software Compatibility (If two programs are chosen at random, the probability that they are compatible is equal to zero); Law of Option Preferences (When two people share a computer, their software option preferences will differ in every possible way); Law of Expectation (Consumer expectations always outpace advances in software technology); and, Law of the Titanic (Bug-free software isn&#39;t).</p>

Using the Extensible Markup Language (XML), an XML namespace is a collection of element type and attribute names. These element types and attribute names are uniquely identified by the name of the unique XML namespace of which they are a part. In an XML document, any element type or attribute name can thus have a two-part name consisting of the name of its namespace and then its local (functional) name.</p>

Practically speaking, however, a national standard is any standard that is widely used and recognized within a country. In this context, even government standards, such as those issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), can be considered national standards.</p>

                        <h3>Normalization</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> The process of organizing data into tables in such a way that the results of using the database are always unambiguous and as intended. Normalization is typically a refinement process after the initial exercise of identifying the data objects that should be in the database, identifying their relationships, and defining the tables required and the columns within each table. First normal form (1NF) is the &#34;basic&#34; level of normalization: Data and information are contained in two-dimensional tables with rows and columns. Each column corresponds to a sub-object or an attribute of the object represented by the entire table. Each row represents a unique instance of that sub-object or attribute and must be different in some way from any other row (that is, no duplicate rows are possible). All entries in any column must be of the same kind. For example, in the column labeled &#34;Date,&#34; only dates are permitted. In Second normal form (2NF), the tables are in first normal form and, in addition, each column in a table that is not a determiner of the contents of another column must itself be a function of the other columns in the table. At the second normal form, modifications are still possible because a change to one row in a table may affect data that refers to this information from another table. In Third normal form (3NF), the tables are in second normal form and, in addition, there is no transitive functional dependency. For example, if A is functionally dependent on B, and B is functionally dependent on C, then C is transitively dependent on A via B. In Domain/key normal form (DKNF), a key uniquely identifies each row in a table. A domain is the set of permissible values for an attribute. By enforcing key and domain restrictions, the database is assured of being freed from modification anomalies. DKNF is the normalization level that most designers aim to achieve.</p>

Any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. Any information that can be used to distinguish one person from another and can be used for de-anonymizing anonymous data can be considered personally identifiable data. 3. Data are identifiable if the information contains the name of an individual, or other identifying items such as birth date, address or geocoding. Data will be identifiable if the information contains a unique personal identifier and the holder of the information also has the master list linking the identifiers to individuals. Data may also be identifiable because of the number of different pieces of information known about a particular individual. It may also be possible to ascertain the identity of individuals from aggregated data where there are very few individuals in a particular category. Identifiability is dependent on the amount of information held and also on the skills and technology of the holder.</p>

A PID record is a type of record that includes property information that characterizes the digital object it is identifying. Important parts of a PID record are location and checksum. However there is a large variation in usage. In some data models the PID is simply used as a unique label with an empty record. A PID record has a lifecycle including creation, publication, Curation and the destruction.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> The Principal Investigator (P.I.) is a researcher who has a research leadership role and is the point of contact for a project or partnership that applies the scientific method, historical method, or other research methodology for the advancement of knowledge resulting in independent, objective, high quality, traceable, and reproducible results. The P.I. has primary responsibility for the intellectual direction and integrity of the research or research-related activity, including data production, findings and results, and ensures ethical conduct in all aspects of the research process including but not limited to the treatment of human and animal subjects, conflicts of interest, data acquisition, sharing and ownership, publication practices, responsible authorship, and collaborative research and reporting. While various tasks may be delegated to team members, some of whom may have greater expertise in specific areas, the P.I. is familiar with the various technical and scientific aspects of a project and how they fit together, is able to identify and remediate gaps, and ensure communication within the team and with users of the research data and results. The project may be very small involving only a few people (or even only one person - the P.I.), or extremely large involving many groups and multiple P.I.s and/or co-P.I.s. Depending on the type of organization (e.g., university, industry, institute, laboratory, government program, etc.) the role of the P.I., how that role fits into the organizational structure, and how it relates to roles within and outside of the organization can vary.</p>

The program manager is judged on the elements time, cost, and scope, cumulatively for all the projects and operations within the program. Program management decisions are both tactical and strategic in nature. The strategy aspects of these decisions must consider multidimensional impacts beyond the near-term delivery dates of the project. In addition to delivery and execution, the program manager has to also be concerned with the overall health and effectiveness of the program over the long term. The program manager may have to accept calculated risk when he or she is unable to obtain clarity from the organization and then define clarity in his or her own terms. Accepting chaos, allowing chaos to exist, or passing down chaos all signal a lack of integrity and this does not create a culture conducive to successful projects.</p>

Proportionate governance operates in situations that are too variable to be regulated by hard laws (e.g., custom data access requests). It requires that analytical judgments be performed to ensure that the governance mechanisms deployed for a given research proposal correspond to the level of risk it entails. Proportionality is an important cross-cutting consideration across all types of governance that are put in place.</p>

Provenance metadata that indicates the relationship between two versions of data objects and is generated whenever a new version of a dataset is created. Examples include: (i) the name of the program that generated the new version, (ii) the commit id of the program in a code version control system like GitHub, (iii) the identifiers of any other datasets or data objects that may have been used in creating the new version. Provenance information is gathered along the data lifecycle as part of curation processes. A finer level of provenance metadata would be concerned only with data flowing between various stores such as curated databases and managed repositories. Provenance metadata is designed to allow queries over the relationship between versions, and includes either or both fine-grained and coarse-grained provenance data. Different applications may store different provenance data.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> A process in which files are first parsed (assigned to appropriate fields in a record) and then translated to a common format. For example, if an original record had the client&#39;s name and address as &#34;Bob Jones, VP Acme. Co., 15 S. Main St, Brooklyn&#34; the standardized record might read &#34;Bob Jones, Vice President, Acme Corporation, 15 South Main Street, Brooklyn, New York&#34;. Data often lack consistency simply because there are a many of ways of saying the same thing. Standardizing the record ensures that when a query is run for a particular field, accurate results will be returned.</p>

                        <h3>Relational database</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> A collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables. The standard user and application program interface to a relational database is the structured query language (SQL). SQL statements are used both for interactive queries for information from a relational database and for gathering data for reports. In addition to being relatively easy to create and access, a relational database has the important advantage of being easy to extend. After the original database creation, a new data category can be added without requiring that all existing applications be modified. A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories. Each table (which is sometimes called a relation) contains one or more data categories in columns. Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns. For example, a typical business order entry database would include a table that described a customer with columns for name, address, phone number, and so forth. Another table would describe an order: product, customer, date, sales price, and so forth. A user of the database could obtain a view of the database that fitted the user&#39;s needs. For example, a branch office manager might like a view or report on all customers that had bought products after a certain date. A financial services manager in the same company could, from the same tables, obtain a report on accounts that needed to be paid. When creating a relational database, the domain of possible values in a data column can be defined as well as further constraints that may apply to that data value. For example, a domain of possible customers could allow up to ten possible customer names but be constrained in one table to allowing only three of these customer names to be specifiable.</p>

In data management context: The generation of a copy of a data object that is referenced by the same name, but with a different replica number. When changes are made to the data object, the replica can be updated to track the changes. AKA, duplication. As part of replication data may be given a PID for a repository. Enhanced metadata may be stored in a repository as part of replication. A PID should allow replicated from different communities to be identified as such. Related term replica number, PID, repository. 2. In the context of research: The evaluation of scientific claims by independent investigators using independent methods, data, equipment, and protocols (Peng, 2011). 3. In the context of measurement: Repeated measurement of the same object.</p>

All data and code are made available for 3rd-party verification of reproducibility. Note that reproducibility is a different concept from replicability. In the latter case, the final published data are linked to sufficiently detailed methods and information for a 3rd-party to be able to verify the results based on the independent collection of new raw data using similar or different methods but leading to comparable results.</p>

Requirements analysis is a team effort that must take into account hardware, software, end use, and human factors engineering expertise. Requirements analysis also requires skills in dealing with people. Requirements analysis involves frequent communication with end users to determine specific feature expectations, resolution of conflict or ambiguity in requirements as demanded by the various users or groups of users, avoidance of feature creep and documentation of all aspects of the project development process from start to finish. Energy should be directed towards ensuring that the final system or product conforms to client needs rather than attempting to mold user expectations to fit the requirements.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> Activities and processes in a digital environment that lead to the publication of research data, associated metadata and accompanying documentation and software code on the Web. In contrast to interim or final published products, workflows are the means to curate, document, and review, and thus ensure and enhance the value of the published product. Workflows can involve both humans and machines and often humans are supported by technology as they perform steps in the workflow. Similar workflows may vary in the details depending on the research discipline, data publishing product and/or the host institution of the workflow (e.g., individual publisher/journal, institutional repository, discipline-specific repository)</p>

Retention schedules are determined by the record type and the business as well as legal and compliance requirements associated with the data. Retention schedules establish guidelines regarding how long important information must remain accessible for future use or reference as well as when and how the data can be destroyed when it is no longer needed. Retention schedules are established based on data type and ownership as well as aspects such as the data&#39;s business value and regulatory compliance mandates. The schedules outline the business reason for retaining specific records and designate what should be done with the data when it&#39;s eligible for disposal.</p>

                        <p><strong>Long Definition:</strong> “Safeguarding science” encompasses a spectrum of activities from risk-awareness and good-security hygiene (cybersecurity, export control awareness, IP protection) to measures that protect researcher safety, preserve research continuity in crises, and maintain scientific integrity against disinformation or undue influence. It seeks to enable responsible openness and international collaboration while reducing risks to people and sensitive work. Toolkits and guidance emphasize proportionate, research-friendly measures that preserve academic freedom and collaboration. Principles underpinning safeguarding science include transparency, predictability, engagement and inclusivity, protection of researchers and scientists, consistency, breadth and depth of perspectives, and shared responsibility. Potential consequences of theft or unintended use of scientific/research findings include diminished trust and confidence; loss of research data; unwanted access and potential interference; loss of exclusive control over intellectual property, patent opportunities, and potential revenue; legal or administrative consequences; loss of potential future partnerships; tarnished reputation.</p>

The term is used in discussing both relational databases and object-oriented databases. The term sometimes seems to refer to a visualization of a structure and sometimes to a formal text-oriented description. Two common types of database schemata are the star schema and the snowflake schema. 2. A formal expression of an inference rule for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. The expression is a generalized axiom in which specific values or cases are substituted for each symbol in the axiom to derive a specific inference.</p>

Semi-structured data lie somewhere between structured and unstructured data. They are not organized in a complex manner that makes sophisticated access and analysis possible. However, they may have information associated with them, such as metadata tagging that allows elements contained to be addressed. Example: A Word document is generally considered to be unstructured data. However, metadata tags could be added in the form of keywords and other metadata that represent the document content and make it easier for that document to be found when people search for those terms -- the data are now semi-structured. Nevertheless, the document still lacks the complex organization of a database, so falls short of being fully structured data</p>

This requires identifying the IP address and the physical path name within the storage location where a data object will be stored. The sequence of these chained activities is conceptualized as a workflow object. For retrieval, the data object location is specified by the storage location and the physical path name.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> Synthetic data is information that&#39;s been generated on a computer to augment or replace real data to improve AI models, protect sensitive data, and mitigate bias.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><strong>Long Definition:</strong> Synthetic data is information that&#39;s artificially manufactured rather than generated by real-world events. It&#39;s created algorithmically and is used as a stand-in for test data sets of production or operational data, to validate mathematical models and to train machine learning (ML) models. While gathering high-quality data from the real world is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, synthetic data technology enables users to quickly, easily and digitally generate the data in whatever amount they desire, customized to their specific needs. The largest application of synthetic data is in the training of neural networks and ML models, as the developers of these models need carefully labeled data sets that could range from a few thousand to tens of millions of items. Synthetic data can be artificially generated to mimic real data sets, enabling creation of a diverse and large amount of training data without spending a lot of money and time.</p>

All possible situations for decisions should be listed, and the action to take in each situation should be specified. A decision table can be inserted into a computer program to direct its processing according to decisions made in different situations. Changes to the decision table are reflected in the program. 4. An HTML table is used to organize Web page elements spatially or to create a structure for data that is best displayed in tabular form, such as lists or specifications.</p>

It stores, manages, and curates digital objects and returns their bit streams when a request is issued. Trusted repositories undergo regular assessments according to a set of rules such as defined by Data Seal of Approval (DSA) or TRAC (ISO 16363). It is well understood that such an assessment has the potential of increasing trust from its depositors and users, but it will not be the only criterion for users. Repositories can be at different stages of assessments. However, it is evident that certain quality criteria need to be met to distinguish trusted repositories from all types of other entities that store data such as notebooks or lab servers.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> An Internet resource with a name that, unlike a URL, has persistent significance - that is, the owner of the URN can expect that someone else (or a program) will always be able to find the resource. A frequent problem in using the Web is that Web content is sometimes moved to a new site or a new page on the same site. Since links are made using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), they no longer work when content is moved.</p>

                        <p><strong>Short Definition:</strong> A unique signature of the semantic content of a digital object. It is not simply a checksum of a binary data file. Instead, the UNF algorithm approximates and normalizes the data stored within. A cryptographic hash of that normalized (or canonicalized) representation is then computed. The signature is thus independent of the storage format. E.g., the same data object stored in, say, SPSS and Stata, will have the same UNF.</p>

The Identity Ecosystem will add another layer of security, aimed at reducing identity theft and simplifying the user experience for various other types of electronic transactions.

Normalization is typically a refinement process after the initial exercise of identifying the data objects that should be in the database, identifying their relationships, and defining the tables required and the columns within each table. First normal form (1NF) is the \"basic\" level of normalization: Data and information are contained in two-dimensional tables with rows and columns. Each column corresponds to a sub-object or an attribute of the object represented by the entire table. Each row represents a unique instance of that sub-object or attribute and must be different in some way from any other row (that is, no duplicate rows are possible). All entries in any column must be of the same kind. For example, in the column labeled \"Date,\" only dates are permitted. In Second normal form (2NF), the tables are in first normal form and, in addition, each column in a table that is not a determiner of the contents of another column must itself be a function of the other columns in the table. At the second normal form, modifications are still possible because a change to one row in a table may affect data that refers to this information from another table. In Third normal form (3NF), the tables are in second normal form and, in addition, there is no transitive functional dependency. For example, if A is functionally dependent on B, and B is functionally dependent on C, then C is transitively dependent on A via B. In Domain/key normal form (DKNF), a key uniquely identifies each row in a table. A domain is the set of permissible values for an attribute.

In addition to being relatively easy to create and access, a relational database has the important advantage of being easy to extend. After the original database creation, a new data category can be added without requiring that all existing applications be modified. A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories. Each table (which is sometimes called a relation) contains one or more data categories in columns. Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns. For example, a typical business order entry database would include a table that described a customer with columns for name, address, phone number, and so forth. Another table would describe an order: product, customer, date, sales price, and so forth. A user of the database could obtain a view of the database that fitted the user\u0027s needs. For example, a branch office manager might like a view or report on all customers that had bought products after a certain date. A financial services manager in the same company could, from the same tables, obtain a report on accounts that needed to be paid. When creating a relational database, the domain of possible values in a data column can be defined as well as further constraints that may apply to that data value.
