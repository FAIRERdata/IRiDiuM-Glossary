# IRIDiuM-Glossary Developer Manual

## Introduction

This repository contains the IRIDiuM-Glossary, a collection of vocabularies for IRIDiuM.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use the IRIDiuM-Glossary repository, you need to download the repository and install some Python packages. 

1. Download a ZIP file of the IRIDiuM-Glossary repository and extract all files

2. Open the extracted IRIDiuM-Glossary folder in VScode or code editor of choice. Make sure the terminal is navigated to the repository folder.

3. Install the required Python packages, `flask`, `pandas`, and `openpyxl`:

```bash
pip3 install flask pandas
```
If the above does not work, try this: 
```bash
py -m pip install flask pandas openpyxl
```

## Usage

### Gathering Vocabularies

When adding new vocabularies to the IRIDiuM-Glossary, make sure to format them in the same way as the existing vocabularies in 'data/IRiDiuM.xlsx'. This ensures that the vocabularies can be correctly processed by the application.
The ID column refers to the CASRAI terms identifier found at https://web.archive.org/web/20180516211503/http://dictionary.casrai.org/

### Running the Data API

After you have gathered your vocabularies and formatted them correctly, you can run the `data_api.py` script to render an HTML template with the vocabularies.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where `data_api.py` is located.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python3 data_api.py
```
If the above does not work, try:
```bash
py data_api.py
```

### Viewing the Generated HTML

After running the `data_api.py` script, you can view the generated HTML to make sure it was created successfully.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. This is where the Flask server is running.
2. If the HTML was generated successfully, you should see your vocabularies displayed in the browser.
3. If there was an error generating the HTML, you will see an error log in the browser. You can use this log to troubleshoot any issues.

The generated HTML file is saved as `docs/index.html`. This file is a preview of the designated deployment.

### Refreshing the Deployment

If you make changes to any of the code and would like to see those changes reflected in the deployment, you can do so by refreshing `http://localhost:5000`.

1. After making your changes, save your files and ensure the Flask server is still running.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. Refresh the page.
3. Open `docs/index.html` in your web browser and refresh the page. You should now see the updated version of the HTML.

## Encoding Complications

Please note that Github Pages is encoded using UTF-8; therefore, any symbols not in UTF-8 will be shown as a � symbol. Correct these symbols in the source file Google sheets and then use the new file as the input file. Examples of characters that may have issues are accented characters or variates of symbols (ï, é, —).
